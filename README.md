# Lethal Company Cinematic Freecam

This mod enables Lethal Company's built in cinematic freecam by using the built in keybind. To toggle freecam, press the 'C' key. When in freecam, you can use the sprint button to increase the camera speed while holding it.

LCCinematicFreecam was made for capturing cinematic videos for the upcoming LCVR mod, but has been made public for everybody to use.

I literally made this mod in like 30 minutes so it's not super fancy.
